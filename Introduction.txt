Introduction

Hello, I am Neetu Regmi. I am a 1st year Ph.D student in the Department of Statistics . I finished my undergraduate with a major in Mathematics and a minor in business. I used a little bit of python for modelling data for 3rd generation horizon sizes in my undegraduate research. I own a macOS Mojave. I am looking forward to learn and use different statistical tools for this class. 

I started playing tennis this summer. Even though, I am a novice, I enjoy playing tennis as much as I love watching comedy sitcoms, standup comedy shows. Beside that, I love cooking as well. Sometimes, I like to watch documentary shows like planet earth that tells us about all kinds of life exsiting on earth and I find those shows fascinating to watch.
